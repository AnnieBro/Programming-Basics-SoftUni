# Simple Operations and Calculations - Lab

The exercises are as follows:

### 1. Trapezoid Area
  - Input: Three real numbers **b1**, **b2** and **h**.
  - End of program: 
      - Output to the second decimal place area of trapezoid. The formula is **(b1 + b2) * h / 2**.
  
### 2. Triangle Area 
  - Input: Side and height of triangle (real numbers).
  - End of program: 
    - Output to the second decimal place area of triangle. The formula is **a * h / 2**.
  
### 3. Celsius to Fahrenheit
  - Input: Degrees in Celsius (real number) 
  - End of program: 
    - Output to the second decimal place the degrees in Fahrenheit.
  
### 4 Vegetable Market
> A gardener sells his produce on the market.
  - Input: Price per kilo of vegetables [0.00… 1000.00] **N**, price per kilo of fruits [0.00… 1000.00] **M**, total kilos of vegetables [0… 1000] and total kilos of fruits [0… 1000].
  - End of program: 
    - Output to the second decimal place total money earned in euros.
  
### 5. Training Lab
> A training lab for students is rectangular in shape.
  - Input: Width **w** and height **h** in metres. Limitations: **3 <= h <= w <= 100**
    - The training lab does not have columns and has an entrance at the back side with an opening of 160 cm, because of which one working space is lost.
    - It is separated in two parts with a corridor in the middle at least 100 cm in width.
    - There are desks in the left and right side of the training lab, each space taking up 70 x 120 cm (a desk 70 x 40 and chair space 70 x 80)
    - There is a podium with sizes 160 x 120 cm, because of which 2 working spaces are lost.
  - End of program: 
    - Output number of working spaces in the training lab.
  
### 6. Fishland
> George is expecting guests, so he wants to buy fish for dinner.
  - Input: Prices per kilo of mackerel [0.00… 40.00] and sprat [0.00… 30.00] and total kilos of chamois [0.00… 50.00], horse mackerel [0.00… 70.00] and mussels [0… 100].
    - These are the following prices:
      - Chamois – 60% more expensive than mackerel
      - Horse mackerel – 80% more expensive than sprat
      - Mussels – 7.50 per kilo
  - End of program: 
    - Output to the second decimal place the total price.
  
### 7. House Painting
> A house needs to be painted – the walls in green and the roof in red.
  - Input: Height of house **x** [2.00… 100.00], width of side wall **y** [2.00… 100.00] and height of triangular side of roof [2.00… 100.00].
    - 1 litre of green paint is enough for 3.4 sq. m, while 1 litre of red paint – for 4.3 sq. m.
    - The front and back walls are squares with a side **x** and there is a door on the front wall with sizes 1.2m x 2m.
    - The side walls are rectangles with sides **x** and **y** and on each of them there is a square window with a side 1.5m.
    - The roof consists of two rectangles with sides **x** and **y** and two equilateral triangles with side **x** and height **h**.
  - End of program: 
    - Output on two separate lines to the second decimal place the litres of green and red paint used.

### 8. Weather Forecast 
  - Input: Weather (string)
  - End of program:
    - If the weather is **”sunny”**, output: **”It’s warm outside”**.
    - In any other case, output **”It’s cold outside!”**.
  
### 9. Weather Forecast Pt. 2
  - Input: Temperature in Celsius [5.00… 35.00].
  - End of program: 
    - If the temperature is between 26.00 and 35.00 degrees, output **”Hot”**.
    - If the temperature is between 20.1 and 25.9 degrees, output **”Warm”**.
    - If the temperature is between 15.00 and 20.00 degrees, output **”Mild”**.
    - If the temperature is between 12.00 and 14.9 degrees, output **”Cool”**.
    - If the temperature is between 5.00 and 11.9 degrees, output **”Cold”**.

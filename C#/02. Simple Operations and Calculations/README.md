# Simple Operations And Calculations

This (as a lecture) consists of:
  - Basic types of data (int, double, char, string, bool)
  - MIN/MAX values of data types integer and double
  - Reading user input (Read method)
  - Printing output (Write and WriteLine methods)
  - Arithmetic operations and expressions using them (+, -, *, /, %)
  - Using output templates for printing ({0}, {1}, {2}, ... and interpolation $) 
  - Methods from Math class (Ceiling, Floor, Abs, Round)
  - Number rounding and formatting 
  - Type conversion (string to int, string to double)

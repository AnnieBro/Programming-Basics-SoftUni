# Simple Operations and Calculations - Exercise

The exercises are as follows:

### 1. USD to BGN
> Converts USD to BGN to second decimal place.

### 2. Radians to Degrees
> Converts radians to degrees.

### 3. Rectangle Area
> Input the coordinates of two opposite corners of a rectangle (x1, y1) and (x2, y2).
Output the area and perimeter of the rectangle on two separate lines to the second decimal place.

### 4. Tailoring Workshop
> A tailoring workshop takes orders for tailoring table cloths and table squares. The table cloths are rectangular, while the table squares are square and both of their amounts are equal. The side of a table square is half the length a table, while the table cloth has to be 30 cm off every side of the table. A sq. m of fabric for a table cloth costs 7 dollars, while a sq. m of fabric for a table suqare - 9 dollars. Input the amount of tables (whole number) and the length and width (real number) of each table. Output in two lines: "(price in dollars) USD" "(price in leva) BGN" to the second decimal point.

### 5. Dance Hall
> A dance hall is rectangular with a size of L (length) and W (width). There is a square wardrobe with a side A and a rectangular bench with a size 10 times smaller than the dance hall itself. The space a dancer takes is 40 sq. cm and needs an extra 7000 sq. cm for freedom of movement. Input L, W and A (real numbers) and output the amount of dancers that can fit in the dance hall, rounded down to the closest whole number.

### 6. Charity Campaign
> A charity campaign is going on in a bakery. Input the amount of days the campaign is going for and the amount of bakers, then input the amount of cakes, waffles and pancakes a baker does in one day (all whole numbers). The prices are: cake - 45 lv, waffle - 5.80 lv, pancake - 3.20 lv. 1/8 of the collected money goes for ingridients for the baked goods. Output the final collected charity money up to the second decimal place.

### 7. Alcohol Market
> George goes to an alcohol market to buy alcohol for a party. Input the whiskey price in leva, the amount of beer, wine, rakiya and whiskey in litres (all separately, real number). The rakiya price is 50% cheaper than that of whiskey, the wine price is 40% cheaper than that of rakiya and the beer price is 80% cheaper than that of rakiya. Output the total price of the alcohol up to the second decimal place.

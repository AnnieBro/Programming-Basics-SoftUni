# Simple Operations and Calculations - Extra

The exercises are as follows:

### 1. Trapezoid Area
> Input real numbers b1, b2 and h (real numbers) and calculate the area of a trapezoid with bases b1 and b2 and a height h up to the second decimal point.

### 2. Triangle Area
> Input a side and a height (real numbers) of a triangle and output the area up to the second decimal point.

### 3. Celsius to Fahrenheit
> Input Celsius degrees (real number) and output them converted to Fahrenheit degrees up to the second decimal point.

### 4. Vegetable Market
> A gardener is selling his garden's vegetables for N leva per kilo and his fruit for M leva per kilo. Unput N and M (real numbers) and the kilograms of the vegetables and the fruit (separately, whole numbers). Output the outcome in euros up to the second decimal point.

### 5. Training Lab
> A training lab has an area of w (width) * h (height) sq. m without columns inside. The lab is separated into two sections - a left and a right one with a corridor of 100 cm width in the middle between the two sections. There are rows of desks in both sections, as one workplace takes up 70 * 120 cm space (a table with a size of 70 * 40 cm and a chair and crossing space of 70 * 80 cm). There is an entrance door with 160 cm opening, because of which exactly 1 workplace is lost, and front space of 160 * 120 cm, because of which exactly 2 workplaces are lost. Input the width and height of the lab and output the total amount of workplaces available in it.

### 6. Fishland
> George wants to buy chamois, horse mackerel and mussels for his guests. The prices are as follows: chamois - 60% more expensive thank mackerel, horse mackerel - 80% more expensive than sprat, mussels - 7.50 lv per kilo. Input the prices of the mackerel and sprat (real numbers), as well as the amount in kilos of chamois, horse mackerel (both real numbers) and mussels (whole number). Output the total price in leva up to the second decimal point.

### 7. House Painting
> A house needs to be painted with green and red paint - the walls are painted in green, while the roof - in red. One litre of green paint is used per every 3.4 sq. m painted and one litre of red paint - per every 4.3 sq. m. The walls have the following sizes - the front and back wall are squares with a side **x**, there is a 1.2 m * 2 m door on the front wall; the side walls are rectangles with side **x** and **y** and there is a square 1.5 m window on both walls. The roof consists of two **x** * **y** rectangles and two equilateral triangles with a side **x** and height **h**. Input **x**, **y** and **h** (whole numbers) and output on two separate lines the amounts of green and red paint used in litres up to the second decimal point.

### 8. Weather Forecast
> Input adjective that describes the weather. If it's **sunny**, output "It's warm outside!". In all other cases, output "It's cold outside!".

### 9. Weather Forecast pt. 2
> Input degrees in Celsius (real number) and output what the weather is by this scale: 26.00 - 35.00 - **Hot**, 20.1 - 25.9 - **Warm**, 15.00 - 20.00 - **Mild**, 12.00 - 14.9 - **Cool**, 5.00 - 11.9 - **Cold**. If the entered degrees are not on the scale, output **unknown**.

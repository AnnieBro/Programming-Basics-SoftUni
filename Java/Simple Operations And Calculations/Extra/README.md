# Simple Operations and Calculations - Extra

The exercises are as follows:

### 1. Trapezoid Area
> Input real numbers b1, b2 and h (real numbers) and calculate the area of a trapezoid with bases b1 and b2 and a height h up to the second decimal point.

### 2. Triangle Area
> Input a side and a height (real numbers) of a triangle and output the area up to the second decimal point.

### 3. Celsius to Fahrenheit
> Input Celsius degrees (real number) and output them converted to Fahrenheit degrees up to the second decimal point.

### 4. Vegetable Market
> A gardener is selling his garden's vegetables for N leva per kilo and his fruit for M leva per kilo. Unput N and M (real numbers) and the kilograms of the vegetables and the fruit (separately, whole numbers). Output the outcome in euros up to the second decimal point.

### 5. Training Lab
> A training lab has an area of w (width) * h (height) sq. m without columns inside. The lab is separated into two sections - a left and a right one with a corridor of 100 cm width in the middle between the two sections. There are rows of desks in both sections, as one workplace takes up 70 * 120 cm space (a table with a size of 70 * 40 cm and a chair and crossing space of 70 * 80 cm). There is an entrance door with 160 cm opening, because of which exactly 1 workplace is lost, and front space of 160 * 120 cm, because of which exactly 2 workplaces are lost. Input the width and height of the lab and output the total amount of workplaces available in it.

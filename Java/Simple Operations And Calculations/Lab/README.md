The exercises are as follows:

### 1. Greeting By Name

### 3. Square Area
> Reads a whole number **a** (by user input) and outputs the area of a square with a side **a**.

### 4. Inches to Centimeters
> Reads a real number (by user input) and outputs this number converted from inches to centimeters.

### 5. Projects Creation
> An architect needs approximately three hours to finish a project. 
The console reads the name of the architect and the number of projects (by user input). 
The output is: "The architect (name) will need (necessary hours) hours to complete (project amount) project/s."

### 6. Circle Area and Perimeter
> Reads a real number **r** (by user input) and outputs the area and the perimeter of a circle with a radius **r** on two separate lines. 
Format the output to the second decimal place.

### 7. Pet Shop
> At a pet shop the dog food is 2.50 lv. per packet, while every other - 4.00 lv. 
Reads the number of dogs and the number of other animals and outputs: "(total) lv." to the second decimal place.

### 8. Yard Greening

Reads the sq. m that shall be greened (by user input) (real number) and outputs two lines: "The final price is: (price) lv."; 
"The discount is: (discount) lv." to the second decimal place.

### 9. Birthday

A certain percentage of the volume is taken up with the aquarium's utilities.

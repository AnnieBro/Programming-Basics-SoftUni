# Simple Operations And Calculations

This (as a lecture) consists of:
  - Basic types of data (char, int, double, boolean, String)
  - MIN/MAX values of data types integer and double
  - Reading user input with Scanner utility
  - Arithmetic operations and expressions using them (+, -, *, /, %)
  - Methods from Math class (ceil, floor, Abs, round, sqrt, pow, PI)
  - Printing output (print, println, printf)
  - Using output templates for printf (%s, %d, %f, %c)
  - Type conversion (String to int, String to double, int to double, double to int, char to int, int to char)

# For-Loop - Lab

The exercises are as follows:

### 1. Numbers from 1 to 100
  - **Input**: (none)
  - **End of program**: Output all numbers from 1 to 100 on a separate line each.

### 2. Latin Letters
  - **Input**: (none)
  - **End of program**: Output all Latin letters from 'a' to 'z' on a separate line each.
  
### 3. Sum Numbers
  - **Input**: **n** (whole number) and continuously input **n** amount of whole numbers.
  - **End of program**: When **n** is reached, output sum of all numbers.
  
### 4. Number Sequence
  - **Input**: **n** (whole number) and continuously input **n** amount of whole numbers.
  - **End of program**: When **n** is reached, output:
    - **"Max number: (largest number)"**
    - **"Min number: (smallest number)"**
  
### 5. Left and Right Sum
> A program that checks whether the sum of the first **n** numbers is equal to the sum of the second **n** numbers.
  - **Input**: **n** (whole number) and continuously input 2 * **n** whole numbers.
  - **End of program**: When 2 * **n** is reached:
    - If the sums are equal, output:
      - **"Yes, sum = (sum)"**
    - If the sums aren't equal, output:
      - **"No, diff = (absolute difference between sums)"**
  
### 6. Odd/Even Sum
> A program that checks whether the sum on even positions is equal to the sum on odd positions.
  - **Input**: **n** (whole number) and continuously input **n** whole numbers.
  - **End of program**: When **n** is reached:
    - If the sums are equal, output:
      - **"Yes"**
      - **"Sum = (sum)"**
    - If the sums aren't equal, output:
      - **"No"**
      - **"Diff = (absolute difference between sums)"**
  
### 7. Vowels Sum
> A program that sums the values of the vowels in a string of text.
  - **Input**: Text (String)
    - The values go like this:
      - a = 1
      - e = 2
      - i = 3
      - o = 4
      - u = 5
  - **End of program**: When all the letters are checked, output the sum.
  
### 8. Clever Lilly
> Lilly is **n** years old now and has received various presents for her past birthdays - either money or a toy. Now she's saving **X** leva for a new washing machine from her birthday money throughout the years and by selling her birthday toys for **P** leva each. Check if she has saved up enough money for a washing machine.
  - **Input**: Age of Lilly (**n**) [1... 77], the price of the washing machine (**X**) [1.00... 10 000.00] and the price of a single toy (**P**) [0... 40].
    - For every uneven age, she receives a toy for her birthday.
    - For every even age, she receives money for her birthday.
    - She got 10.00 lv for her 2nd birthday.
    - Every second birthday she receives 10 leva more than on the previous even birthday.
    - Lilly's brother takes 1.00 lv from her birthday money every time she receives money.
    - She sold her birthday toys for **P** leva each and added the money to her savings.
    - She wants to buy a washing machine for **X** leva.
  - **End of program**: When **n** is reached:
    - If she saved enough money, output:
      - **"Yes! (money left after purchase)"**
    - If she couldn't save enough money, output:
      - **"No! (rest of money needed)"**

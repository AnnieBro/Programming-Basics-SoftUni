# While-Loop - Lab

The exercises are as follows:

### 1. Numbers in Range
> Input positive number in the range [1...100]. 
  - If number is not in range, output **"Invalid number!"** and input new number.
  - When a number in range is input, output: **"The number is: (number)"**.

### 2. Sequence
> Input number and output all numbers smaller or equal to the number in sequence **1, 3, 7, 15, 31, ...** on a new line each. The sequence is a(n) = a(n-1) * 2 + 1.

### 3. Account Balance
> Input number of money deposits into bank account (whole number) and every next input is the money deposited in bank account. All money values are to the second decimal place.
  - after every successful deposit, output: **"Increase: (new money)**.
  - if the amount is under 0, output: **"Invalid operation!"** and end program.
  - after reaching the amount of installments, end the program.
  - end of program: **"Total: (total deposit)"**

### 4. Max Number
> Input **n** amount of whole numbers and output the biggest of them. Read the amount first and then each number separately.

### 5. Min Number
> Input **n** amount of whole numbers and output the smallest of them. Read the amount first and then each number separately.

### 6. Graduation 
> Input name of student and on each new line input their yearly average starting from first grade up till twelfth grade. 
  - The student passes to the next grade if their average is over or equal to 4.00.
  - If average is under 4.00, they will repeat the year.
  - After successful graduation of 12th grade, output (average grade to second decimal place): **"(Student's name) graduated. Average grade: (average of all SUCCESSFUL grades)"**.

### 7. Graduation pt. 2
> Input name of student and on each new line input their yearly average starting from first grade up till twelfth grade. 
  - The student passes to the next grade if his average is over or equal to 4.00.
  - If average is under 4.00, they will repeat the year.
  - If they repeat the same year for the second time, output (grade with number): **"(Student's name) has been excluded at (grade they repeated again) grade"** and end the program.
  - After successful graduation of 12th grade, output (average grade to second decimal place): **"(Student's name) graduated. Average grade: (average of all SUCCESSFUL grades)"**.

### 8. Moving
> For his 18th birthday Hose decided he wants to rent an apartment. He packed his luggage in cardboard boxes and after finding an apartment, he starts moving the boxes a couple at a time. He has a limited amount of space for the luggage. Input width, length and height of the free space in the apartment (whole numbers) and start inputting on every new line the amount of boxes he moves until writing a **Done** command.
  - each box is 1m x 1m x 1m (1 cubic metre).
  - if you write **Done** before running out of space, output: **"(Free space in cubic metres) Cubic meters left."**.
  - if he runs out of space before **Done** command, output: **"No more free space! You need (needed c. m for last input boxes) Cubic meters more."**

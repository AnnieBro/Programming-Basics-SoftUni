# Conditional Statements

This (as a lecture) consists of:
  - Equality and relational operators (==, !=, >, >=, <, <=)
  - Blocks of code ( {} )
  - Simple conditional statements (if / else if / else)
  - Series of conditional statements (multiple else ifs)
  - Span of a variable (up until the block of code it is initialised from)
  - Conditional statement **switch-case** 
  - Debugging (in IntelliJ IDEA)

# Programming-Basics-SoftUni

Tasks I have done from any of the Programming Basics courses from Software University - Sofia.
The folders here (will) present the programming languages in use, which are (the checked ones are the completed ones):
- [ ] Java
- [ ] JavaScript
- [ ] Python
- [ ] C#

The tasks are low-level and very basic. The descriptions are originally in Bulgarian, so I will briefly translate them in a README.md in each folder for each group of exercises. The groups of exercises given by SoftUni are separated in:
  - Lab       (first batch, given after the lecture about the topic)
  - Exercise  (second batch, given after exercise solving with the lecturer)
  - More      (extra exercises that are not included in the final grade)

Folder order:
Programming Language/Topic/Exercise Group

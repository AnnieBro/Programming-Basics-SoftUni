# Programming-Basics-SoftUni

Tasks I have done from any of the Programming Basics courses from Software University - Sofia.
The folders here (will) present the programming languages in use, which are (the checked ones are the completed basics courses):
- [x] Java        (01.06.2019 - 29.07.2019)
- [ ] Python      (31.08.2019 - 04.11.2019)
- [ ] C#          (31.08.2019 - 04.11.2019)
- [ ] JavaScript  (Not signed up yet)

The tasks are low-level and very basic. The descriptions are originally in Bulgarian, so I will briefly translate them in a README.md in each folder for each group of exercises. The groups of exercises given by SoftUni are separated in:
  - Lab       (first batch, given after the lecture about the topic)
  - Exercise  (second batch, given after exercise solving with the lecturer)
  - More      (extra exercises that are not included in the final grade)

Folder order:
Programming Language/Topic/Exercise Group

Each exercise group generally consists of:
1. README.md file with the translated exercise descriptions and **occassionally** a short description to the topic itself;
2. .docx file with the original exercise descriptions, solutions, screenshots, sample tests and so on;
3. .java files with the corresponding class/file name and code

> Note that as an ongoing repository, small formatting changes may occur, as well as problem description structures may change with upcoming updated topics. Please bear with those changes as time goes by and new content is added, my aim is to make the descriptions more comprehensible..
> I am still testing stuff out and working on some other things, so this repository might remain rather empty for some time, but it would definitely be completed to my latest progress at one point in time!
